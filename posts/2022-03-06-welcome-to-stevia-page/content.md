Hi! and welcome to Stevia page. Stevia page is website (blog) template written 
by Bagus Saputra in his spare time. Stevia page primarily written in 
[JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/) programming language with 
[ShowdownJS](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown) as Markdown parser and 
[Bootstrap 3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/) as responsive interface. 
**But** you don't have to worry about any of that to use Stevia page.
